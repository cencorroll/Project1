1. First I added some HTML elements
2. Created a grid in JS using createElement
3. Did a little bit of basic styling in CSS
4. Added my images for player 1 and player 2 in classes
5. Going to pseudocode for the startButton

problem, 07.04.22: at 10pm the grid dissappeared while I was trying to work more on the JS. I will go over the recorded lecture tomorrow.
        - I'm not sure on how to create a grid of buttons using JS
